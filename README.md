# Offline Chessboard Template

A simple chessboard template built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project provides a basic, responsive chessboard layout for use in your own chess game development or as a static chessboard template. The game logic is not included; you can add your own functionality or use this as a starting point. This game is missing a chess engine that's why there is no such great chess logics.

## Features

- **Simple Design**: A clean and minimal chessboard design with easy-to-understand layout and color scheme.

## Tech Stack

- **CSS**: For styling the chessboard and pieces.
- **JavaScript**: Used minimally for basic interactions (if any).
